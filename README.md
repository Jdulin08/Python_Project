# Python_Project:
Function 1: Splitting DNA sequences into codons and adding these codons to a list
Function 2: Cleaning up a DNA sequence before splitting into codons and adding codons to a list.
Function 3: Iterate through a sequence number, count the G's and C's within the sequence number, print the sequence number and GC count within each seuqence number, and then print the total number of GCs all together.
Function 4: Similar steps as function 3, but create GC percentages for each sequence number and print the average GC percentage among all the sequence numbers.
